## Description

This project uses a long short-term memory (LSTM) neural network to predict surf report data. Using hourly data from Morro Bay provided by Surfline, the model predicts surf forecasts based on various input variables, such as buoy wave height, tide, swell period, and beach wave height. The project explores different predictor-target pairs to identify the best predictors for key metrics like wave height at the beach. Model performance is evaluated with unseen data using mean-squared error (MSE) and other metrics. This project demonstrates AI's potential in environmental modeling and offers valuable insights to a broad range of people, spanning from surfers to data scientists.
